================

Transforms all pairwise comparisons of any sized set of 
choice candidates into ordinal preference structures. This script outputs the vertices
of any sized permutahedron and notes the number of transitive and intransitive
structures, by reproducing the projection matrix found [here] (https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/junz/Publication/2004%20Zhang%20JMP%20Permutahedron.pdf).
