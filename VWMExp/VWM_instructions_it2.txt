 Welcome, and thank you for volunteering for our study. In the following
experiment, you will be tasked with remembering the orientations of twostriped circles and recalling the orientation of one of those
gratings after a period of delay.

On the following set of screens, you will be introduced to the experiment
with a series of tutorials. After reading the presented text, press any key
to continue onto the next tutorial. Wait patiently while the next tutorial
prepares itself.

After the tutorial, you will run through 1 block of training trials. Please respond to each trial as carefully and as quickly as possible. Please let the experimenter know when you’ve completed the training block.
